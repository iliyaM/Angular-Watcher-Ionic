	<p>Hello my name is Iliya Melishev and this a continuation of my personal project <strong>Angular-Watcher.com</strong> that i did for the sake of learning angular.</p>
	<p>I decided to switch mobile version of <strong>Angular-Watcher.com</strong> to Android/Ionic.</p>
	<p>They both share <strong>FireStore</strong> databse but use slightly diffrent UI.</p>
	<p>If you have an allready existing account in <strong>Angular-Watcher.com</strong> it will be shared here and vice versa.</p>
	<p>this app allows you to subscribe to tv shows you like and get notifications via email of upcoming episode on the <strong>same day</strong> and a <strong>day before</strong> an episode is beeing released</p>

	<p>This app will change human civilization as we know it! :)</p>


	<h4>Credits:</h4>
	<p>This project is based on this awesome api called <strong>TheMovieDB</strong>	Huge thumbs to the developers.</p>
	<p>I hope you enjoyed using this app.</p>
	<p>If you have any questions/feedback/bugs good or bad you can contact me i will happily reply.</p>
